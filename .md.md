# **Lists**

    how to list, this is pretty messy but bare with me

1. first item
1. second item
1. the number doesn't matter by the way
   - an unordered sub list under a num list

- unordered sub-list

* again

- another way
  - this is fairly normal
    \*but doesn't go deeper

1. num list2
   1. this is a tab space, it needs a 1 to start a new sub-line
   - also this
1. but continuing doesn't need the next number

   1. but it does here

   <br>
   tab in (leading)
   = same line

   <br>
   tab in (leading) and tab out (trailing)  
   = no line break

# **Links**

    this is how to add links to the page

[this is an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[this is an inline-style link with a hover title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](C:\Users\Olu\Desktop\programming_notes\txt.txt)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

<https://google.com>

    below (but hidden) are the links that give the reference links functionality

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

# **Images**

    how to images... you know the deal

Inline-style:
![alt text](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q1BqlYsTb7E/maxresdefault.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style:
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q1BqlYsTb7E/maxresdefault.jpg "Logo Title Text 2"

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

# **Code and Syntax Highlighting**

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are blocked in with 3 backticks

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

and so many more languages!!!
